Scripts to automatically inter-calibrate channels of the EMCal, using an external trigger (cosmic
muon telescope). Run autocalib.py concurrently with a Janus job to automatically perform the calibration,
iterating over several runs. Run gaincalibration.py to analyze just one run and get the new gain setting
recommendations.
